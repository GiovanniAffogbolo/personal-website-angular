    description: "<p>\"The Kansas City Latin Jazz Orchestra is the premier Latin Music ensemble in the Midwest. Founded & Directed by Master Musician Pablo Sanhueza (Chile/KC) KCLJO is the first & only nonprofit in the Midwest dedicated to Salsa & Latin Jazz. With a 2018 audience reach of nearly 40,000 in the Broader KC region and American Southwest--KCLJO is an intercultural, intergenerational organization, bringing transnational experiences to the stage, the dance floor & the heart of the Midwest.\" - <a href='https://www.facebook.com/kclatinjazzorchestra/' class='description-link'>KCLJO website</a><br /> <br /> I joined the organization after meeting Sanhueza in 2015 and quickly became immersed in the study of Afro-Latin music. Since incorporating as a non-profit, KCLJO has expanded beyond simply reproducing Afro-Latin music in concert, taking on an educational role that promotes musical literacy and historical understanding of the genre and culture.</p>"

    description: "<p>\"Base Academy of Music (BAM) is non-profit music organization who makes starting to learn a musical instrument accessible and affordable for urban youth because we believe music education is a reason and means to succeed.\" - <a href='https://bamkc.org' class='description-link'>BAM website</a><br /> <br /> I feel very passionately that access to a decent music education should not be predicated on how much money one's family has. The work I do at BAM is very dear to me because it helps address that systemic inequity. I joined Base Academy of Music in the fall of 2018. Prior to working at BAM, I was irregularly volunteering as a music instructor with the Ivanhoe Community Center in Kansas City, and was ecstatic to find an organization I could join that would make those efforts go much, much farther than they could on an individual level. BAM boasts a sliding scale payment system, an accessible location for inner city families, and a diverse teaching staff that is capable of teaching relevant curriculum and communicating effectively with their students.</p>"
