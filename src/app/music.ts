  description: "<p class='entry-notes'>After joining the Kansas City Latin Jazz Orchestra, I spent many hours studying Afro-Cuban music to get a better understanding of the genre and ensure a more legitimate performance, focusing on the pianists of the tradition in particular. I found myself transcribing famous solos of latin jazz pianists, and noted that published transcriptions of most of the solos I studied didn't exist! To help make the genre more accessible for everybody, I figured I'd publish them myself. Solos from latin jazz giants like Charlie and Eddie Palmieri, Peruchin, and Dayramir Gonzalez included.</p><p>Difficulty ranges from intermediate to advanced. Coming soon.</p>"

  description: "<p>Dr. Smith approached me about writing a second work for her in late 2018. Again drawing from her evocative oil paintings, I chose her depiction of Colter's Hell (shown left), a series of hot springs and geysers that lie along the mouth of the Shoshone River's canyon, as inspiration for the music. The painting depicts an eruption from one of those geysers.</p> <p>The opening gesture of Colter’s Hell mirrors that moment; it is an eruption, an explosion of sound that starts low to the ground and ascends into a dissipating mist, high up into the air. The music explores these natural associations, translated into musical tones, in two movements - “Eruption” and “Sleeping River”.</p> <p>For flute and piano. Duration 10 minutes.</p> <div class='link-wrapper'> <a href='assets\\scores\\colters-hell-score.pdf' class='description-link' target='_blank'>Score</a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw3D_z5qa2s&feature=youtu.be' class='description-link' target='_blank'>Recording</a> </div>"

  description: "<p>The word \"ekmousiké\" is personal adaptation the poetic term \"ekphrasis\", which is used to refer to a vivid rhetorical description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art. The word has Greek roots; \"ek\" is a prefix meaning \"out\" or \"of\", and \"phrasis\", which translates as \"to speak\". In other words, an \"ekphrastic poem\" is a prose approximation of a work of art. I wanted to achieve the same effect but with music, so instead of \"phrasis\", I substituted the Greek word for music, \"mousiké\" (pronounced moo-zee-kay).</p> <p>Dedicated to my grandmother, Dr. Janet Smith, each movement is based off of one of her paintings or poems, and is intended to be a \"vivid musical description\" in the same way an ekphrastic poem would be. In order:</p> <ul id='ekmousike-list'> <li>I. Sunset on Barren River Lake (painting, pictured top left)</li> <li>II. Alone in Mammoth Cave (poem)</li> <li>III. The Color of Death (poem)</li> <li>IV. Winter Peace (painting)</li> <li>V. Trifid Nebula (painting, pictured bottom left)</li> </ul> <p>This work was completed to fulfill my thesis requirement for a Master's Degree in Music Composition. For solo piano. Duration 45 minutes.</p> <div class='link-wrapper'> <a href='assets\\scores\\five-ekmousikes-thesis.pdf' class='description-link' target='_blank'>Score </a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiDgL0LMN2uOKa0r0rSukHwjiWi7lBe3H' target='_blank' class='description-link'>Recordings</a> </div>"

  description: "<p>My first album of composed music.</p> <p>In graduate school, I was learning a lot about electronic production and recording techniques while simultaneously experimenting with electrifying my saxophone sound with a guitar pedal and midi controllers in FL Studio. Each work was created entirely by me, blending acoustically and electronically generated sounds, seeking to capture moods and moments from my own life. Thus, the title \"Isolation Chamber\". The works range from meditative ambience to IDM tone poems about broken bill accepting machines.</p> <div class='link-wrapper'> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiDgL0LMN2uP-OPxEmmO0O_RHj5b8-xzk' class='description-link' target='_blank'>Link to Album</a> </div>"
